# 🎬 Unsupervised ML - Netflix Movies & TV Shows Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to analyze and cluster **Netflix Movies & TV Shows** based on various attributes such as genre, release year, rating etc. The goal is to identify patterns and similarities among the content, enabling better recommendations and insights into Netflix’s vast catalog.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 **Discover hidden patterns** in Netflix content.
- 🎭 **Cluster movies and TV shows** based on genre, release year, and other factors.
- 📊 **Analyze trends** in Netflix’s content distribution.
- 📈 **Provide insights** to enhance content recommendation systems.

## 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset contains key attributes such as:
- 📌 **Show ID** (Unique Identifier)
- 🎬 **Title** (Movie/TV Show Name)
- 📆 **Release Year**
- 🎭 **Genre**
- 🌍 **Country of Origin**
- ⏳ **Duration** (Movie length or number of seasons)
- ⭐ **Rating** (Content Rating) etc.

## 🔎 Approach & Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**
   - 🧹 Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - 🔢 Encoding categorical data for clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - 📊 Identifying trends and correlations among movies & TV shows.
   - 📈 Visualizing distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - 🎭 Transforming categorical features (e.g., genres) into numerical representations.
   - 🏗 Normalizing and scaling data for clustering.

4. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - 🚀 **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting shows into meaningful clusters.
   - 🔍 ** Silhouette Score for Clustering**: metric used to evaluate.
   -   Used the silhouette method and k-means elbow method to find optimal number of clusters and built recommender system by cosine 
       similarity and recommended top ten movies

5. **Visualization & Insights**
   - 🎨 Cluster visualization using **PCA**.
   - 📊 Graphical representation of content clusters.
   
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- 📊 **PCA** for dimensionality reduction
- 🚀 **Unsupervised ML Algorithms** (K-Means,  Silhouette Score for Clustering)

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- 📊 Built clusters that help in recommendation systems.
- 📈 Gained insights into Netflix’s content strategy.
